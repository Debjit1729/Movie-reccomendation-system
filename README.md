# Movie Recommender System

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that implements a movie recommender system using cosine similarity techniques. The recommender system is built to suggest movies to users based on their preferences and the preferences of similar users.

## Features

- **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: The dataset is loaded and preprocessed to ensure that it is suitable for building the recommender system. This includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing the data.

- **Model Building**: The recommender system is constructed using a cosine similarity approach. The model computes similarities between users or items and recommends movies accordingly.

- **Model Evaluation**: The system evaluates the recommendations using various metrics to ensure that the suggestions are relevant and accurate.

- **Top-N Recommendations**: Based on the similarity scores, the system provides the top-N movie recommendations for a given user.
